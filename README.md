# ImagesSlider

It is a slider images created by me.
I have used HTML5,CSS3 and Javascript.
By clicking the buttons arranged on the respective sides of the image, you can scroll through the images, a command enabled through the use of Javascript.
Inside that there are images of different landscapes of bautiful places.
In the bottom of the slider there are few number that each corrispond to an image.In fact,as the image changes,
the number corrisponding to the image's number is  highlighted with different color.
In the sam time, when you click on the pointer, the pointer zoom on itself and change color.
